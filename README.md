### The Problem
We need to track how long items stay in a warehouse before being sold/shipped.

### Rules
First-In-First-Out (FIFO): Oldest inventory gets sold first.

Inventory changes over time:

Inbound: New stock arrives.

Outbound: Stock leaves (oldest goes first).

### Goal
Classify current inventory into 4 age groups:

0-90 days old

91-180 days old

181-270 days old

271-365 days old
